# late.py
A Python script that texts my girlfriend when I'm running home late. It uses Twilio's Python module to send messages to a specific number.

The script is run as follows: py late.py [time]. 

For example, running 'py late.py 8pm' will send a SMS message saying "Hi, I'm really busy in college right now. I should be home by 8pm."

For obvious reasons the phone numbers in my code are fake and my Twilio account SID and authorisation token have been stored as environment variables.
